# WMM
Package wmm is a Go representation of the NOAA World Magnetic Model.
It calculates the various components of the Earth's magnetic field at any
location and any time within the validity period of the model.

## The WMM Model
The World Magnetic Model (WMM) is a component of the 1984 World Geodetic System (WGS84).
The WMM homepage is at https://ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/DoDWMM.shtml.

The WMM models the magnetic field generated by the Earth's core and its change
over a 5-year horizon using a degree and order 12 spherical harmonic expansion.
It is able to calculate the X, Y, and Z components of the geomagnetic field,
its rates of change DX, DY, and DZ, and various derived components
such as the total field F, the total horizontal field H,
the Declination D, the Inclination I, and the Grid
